# Tune Choreography Parameters

## Head Nod (`src/choreography/nod.ts`)

| Param | Value | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `REBOUND_TAU` | 0.11s | Decay time of the rebound after the nod lands |
| `REBOUND_HZ` | 2.6 | Rebound oscillation frequency (~17% overshoot at ~190ms) |
| `LIFT` | 0.25 | Anticipation lift fraction just before the next beat |
| `HALF_TIME_BPM` | 135 | Above this tempo, nod every other beat instead of every beat |
| `NOD_LEAD` | 0.05s | Sample the curve this far ahead to cancel spring lag |
| `DOWNBEAT_ACCENT` | 1.35 | Amplitude multiplier when the nearest landing is a downbeat |

Amplitude: `deg(2.5 + 6.5 * frame.energy) * drive.accent * frame.beatConfidence`.

Spring physics (stiffness, damping), sub-stepped at 240Hz: pitch `(900, 45)`, lift `(900, 45)`, roll `(120, 18)`.

## Header Type (`src/choreography/type.ts`)

| Param | Value | Effect |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `SHOCKWAVE_SPEED` | 2200 px/s | Speed a kick travels outward from the head across the name |
| `EQ_ATTACK` | 0.015s | VU-meter fast attack for the Doto EQ lines |
| `EQ_RELEASE` | 0.22s | VU-meter slow release |
| `EQ_WEIGHT_STEP` | 100 | Coarse quantisation of EQ line weight |
| `HEADER_WEIGHT_STEP` | 50 | Coarse quantisation of header letter weight |
| `ROND_STEP` | 25 | Coarse quantisation of the `ROND` variation axis |

`headerWeight(section, energy, kick) = min(900, 600 + 100*section + 300*(0.5 + 0.5*energy)*kick)`.

Quantisation steps are deliberately coarse: each distinct `font-variation-settings` value forces the browser to re-rasterise 6–12rem glyphs (and re-blur the glass above them) — fine steps drop frames at high refresh rates.

## Font Cycling (`src/choreography/faces.ts`)

- `CYCLE_FONTS`: the old header's 13 fonts, cycled a font per bar when calm, a font per beat in a drop.
- `HISTORY` = 6 steps kept, so a letter the shockwave hasn't reached yet still shows the right (older) face.
- Drops switch to Doto (`DOTO_VARIATION`); calm returns to the name's own Golos face (empty string).

## Glass Shards (`src/choreography/shards.ts`)

- `shardCount`: 3–5 shards normally, 6–8 on a drop (`sectionLevel === 1`).
- `recutDue`: re-cut every 2 bars in calm sections, every bar in a drop; `IDLE_RECUT_MS` (4000ms) when paused.
- A DJ stab (`frame.stabHit`) always forces an immediate re-cut regardless of cadence.

## Value Ranges

| Value | Range | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `frame.kick`/`snare`/`hat`/`energy`/`section`/`bands[i]` | 0..1 | Normalized |
| `frame.beatPhase`/`barPhase` | 0..1 | 0 = on the beat/downbeat |
| `frame.beatConfidence` | 0..1 | 0 with no beat map |
| `frame.stab` | 0..1 | Decays over ~0.3s after a DJ hit |

## Performance Checklist

- [ ] Animation state in `useRef`/`useMemo` (not `useState`)
- [ ] DOM writes go through `setStyle` (`src/choreography/dom.ts`)
- [ ] Per-effect math lives in `src/choreography/*`, unit-tested
- [ ] No CSS transitions on animated properties
- [ ] No object allocations inside animation loops or `useFrame`
- [ ] Springs/histories/cursors created once via `useMemo`, not recreated per frame
